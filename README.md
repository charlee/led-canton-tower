LED Canton Tower
==================

LED Canton Tower (广州塔) is a LED project inspired by the [LED DIY kit from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32932192299.html).

The project consists of two parts:

- the LED tower, which consists of 273 auto-flashing LEDs (16 layers, 16 LED per layer, and 17 LEDs for the top of the tower)
- the controller, driven by four SN74HC595 and an 8051 IC (STC89C52RC)

The completed project can be [viewded on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Wv8ZZeHuso4). And [here](gallery/README.md) are some pictures.
